# AWS_data_pipeline

The scope of this project is discribed in my blogpost on Medium. 

## Data
### Lambda_functions
These functions are stored in AWS Lambda as the lambda function and the corresponding functions stored in helper.py. These are supposed to be run daily at the same time.

### Static_functions
These functiones are ran locally, as they populate the static tables in the database and only updated yearly.
