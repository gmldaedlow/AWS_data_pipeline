# AWS_data_pipeline

The scope of this project is discribed in my [Blogpost on Medium]().
The project is part of the WBS Coding School Datascience Bootcamp.

## Data
### lambda_functions
Python notebook: These functions are stored in AWS Lambda as the lambda function and the corresponding functions stored in helper.py. These are supposed to be run daily at the same time.

### static_functions
Python notebook: These functions are ran locally, as they populate the static tables in the database and only updated yearly.
